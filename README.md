# SampleCode

Welcome to my sample code project! The purpose of this project is to showcase how I structure and write code using C# and the Unity engine, with a focus on card game mechanics.

Please note that this project is not intended for running or use in production. Instead, it serves as a demonstration of how I approach coding and project organization.
